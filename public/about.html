<h1>About Me</h1>

<p>
Hello! I’m <strong>Manjunath</strong>, an enthusiastic learner and technology-driven individual with a strong interest in
software development, electronics, and web technologies. I enjoy exploring how ideas can be transformed into practical,
real-world solutions through code and innovation.
</p>

<p>
I am currently focused on building my skills in programming, embedded systems, and web development. I like working with
languages such as C and PHP, and I enjoy creating simple, functional projects that help me understand both logic and
system design better.
</p>

<p>
Apart from technical learning, I believe in continuous self-improvement and disciplined growth. I am passionate about
learning new tools, solving problems, and developing projects that reflect creativity, clarity, and purpose.
